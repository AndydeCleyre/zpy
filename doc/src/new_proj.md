# A New Project

What we here call a "project" is not *necessarily* an installable
package with a `pyproject.toml`, but rather any folder you want
associated with a virtual environment (venv).

The project folder will usually include, at a minimum,
`requirements.in` and `requirements.txt` files.

We'll create an example project to demonstrate some of the most useful `zpy` commands:

```console
% mkdir newproj
% cd newproj
```
